# YelpCamp

This is a learning project from years ago which creates a simple NodeJS application using Express and MongoDB. This was a project structured by Colte Steel which I used to learn the basics of NodeJS and MongoDB. The application is like Yelp but for camp sites. It has functionality for posting account creation, campground posting, comment posting, and middleware to check for account permissions.
